these was 2 script that makes u capable to encrypt all the data on system linux the local_encrypt use many keys , for every directory there
is a keylogger that make the operation of encryption localy .however the gloabl_encryption use only a key_logger for every single file on the 
system and be more efficient that the other one
it also countain a script that output locations of all directories in ur system

*requirement:
--works only in linux os 
--it require 2 gmail account  in global_encryption

*NB: 
--don't use only in virtual machines coz it's dangerous if u try in ur os  linux or in on friend's pc


 
it also contain a script that make u capable to  send the key_logger in ur gmail account to make sure
that ur key_logger isn't in ur os and make it harder to find the key
